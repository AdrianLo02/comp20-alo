Assignment 5: Security Assessment of 2048 Game Center

1. Nothing has been implemented yet.

2. I briefly discussed the project with my partner Max Cohen and am doing the assessment based on his A4 code. A helpful Piazza post by Ming Chow in response to "Brian" (Pilchik maybe?) nudged me in the right direction for part of the assignment.

3. This assignment took approximately 3 hours to complete in total.
