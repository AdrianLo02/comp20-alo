Assignment 3: MBTA Map and Schedule Rodeo

1. Page loads the Google Maps API. Currently centered on the Tufts campus. Station markers and polylines render properly, based on the line color given by the rodeo. Info windows render with the name of the station but no other information yet. Geolocation features still need to be implemented.

2. I have not collaborated with anyone for this assignment.
