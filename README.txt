This is a repository for containing my (Adrian Lo's) work done for COMP 20 at Tufts University.

My favorite project was the Duck Hunt assignment (A2). It's a shame that we didn't end up going back and building a functional game from what we had, but someday when I have some free time I may go back and do exactly that.

The project I am most proud of is the MBTA assignment (A3). This was the point where I really started to feel comfortable with JavaScript, and I think the final product turned out to be some of the most well-polished work I have done for this class.

I have gotten a great deal out of this class. I feel that I now have a solid foundation in web development (especially front-end) where I had previously only had experience with C++.
