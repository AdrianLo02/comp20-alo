Assignment 4: 2048 Game Center
by Adrian Lo

1. To my knowledge, these are the aspects of the work that need to be implemented:
	-2048 JS code needs to be modified to post the score and grid to the app
	-app needs to submit the json to the mongoDB collection
	-app needs to get the data that has already been posted in the database
	-index needs to display the scores

2. I have not collaborated with anyone for this assignment.

5. These values are stored in local storage, with the best score being the value of the bestScore key and the state of the game being the value of the gameState key.
